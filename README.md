### react-package-rollup - boilerplate for React package bundled with Rollup

1.  Clone the repo.
2.  Initialize new git repo (rm -rf .git and git init)
3.  Change name, author, keywords, repository, and description in package.json file.

While development it is recommended to make sym-link of this package and use it in test project.

1.  Go to root directory and execute `npm link`.
2.  Go to test project and execute `npm link [package name]`.
3.  Now you can import your package as anything else like `import MyComponent from "my-test-package";`.
4.  Go back to your package and start development in watch-mode by `npm run dev`
5.  Now everything you change in **src** will be automatically transpiled by Rollup to es5
    and exported to **lib/index.js** file. Changes will also be reflected in your test project without needing
    to reinstall packages every time something has changed.

Good luck.
